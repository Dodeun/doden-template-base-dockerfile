# The Platform Contract

Contract version: `v3`

The rules a Project's repository must satisfy to be deployable by the
platform. This file is canonical in
[`Dodeun/doden-contract`](https://github.com/Dodeun/doden-contract) and is
copied, unedited, into every Project — so that an agent whose scope is one
repository can read what will judge it without reaching the network, and run
the same command CI runs.

Every rule below has a reason. A rule with no reason is a rule nobody can
argue with when it is wrong, and this file is meant to be argued with.

## What this is not

A green tier-1 check does **not** mean a Project is deployable. It means the
files in the repository are in order. Two things are deliberately outside it:

- **Tier 2 — the repository's own settings.** Branch and tag rulesets,
  required status checks, the empty bypass list. These cannot travel in a
  copy of a repository, so they are audited centrally rather than checked
  here, and no Project holds a credential that can read its own settings.
- **Host and account facts.** The directory a Stack deploys into, the scoping
  of a secrets token, the ownership of a database. These are outside the
  contract entirely, so that a green check is never mistaken for "this will
  deploy". That claim belongs to the deploy script's pre-flight.

## Running the check

It is one implementation. CI and a laptop run the same file, so they cannot
disagree.

**From a Project's CI** — no secret, and none can be asked for:

```yaml
jobs:
  contract:
    uses: Dodeun/doden-contract/.github/workflows/contract-check.yml@v3
```

**From a working tree**, by a human or by an agent:

```sh
git clone --depth 1 -b v3 https://github.com/Dodeun/doden-contract ~/.doden-contract   # once
python3 ~/.doden-contract/check.py .                                                   # per run
```

Python 3 and Docker Compose are all it needs. The checker has no third-party
dependency, on purpose: it is pinned by a tag and nothing updates it, so it
must not be able to break because of somebody else's release.

## The Manifest

`platform.json`, at the root, is the Project's identity and the commands the
platform runs inside its images — and the first rule, because every other
rule reads it. Its schema is
[`platform.schema.json`](https://github.com/Dodeun/doden-contract/blob/v3/platform.schema.json).

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Dodeun/doden-contract/v3/platform.schema.json",
  "slug": "example-project",
  "appName": "Example Project",
  "appHost": "example.doden.dev",
  "profile": "base-dockerfile",
  "addons": {
    "database": {
      "provider": "postgresql",
      "migrate": { "service": "app", "command": "./migrate up" },
      "seed": { "service": "app", "command": "./seed --synthetic" }
    }
  },
  "contractVersion": "v3"
}
```

| Field | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `slug` | The Project's name everywhere a machine reads it: the Compose project name, the Traefik router and service names, the directory on the host, the image repository. |
| `appName` | The Project's name where a person reads it. |
| `appHost` | The public hostname. Read at image-build time as well as at deploy time — a frontend bundle is compiled against it — so changing it means republishing, not redeploying. |
| `profile` | The Template this Project was copied from, which is what that Template decided on its behalf beyond this contract: how its images are built and its tests run, and in some Profiles a language. `base-dockerfile` decides no language. A closed list, so adding one is a version bump rather than a free-text field. |
| `addons` | The **Add-ons** this Project declares: an object whose keys are the Add-ons and whose values carry that Add-on's configuration. Today there is one, `database`, and it carries a `provider` and the `migrate` and `seed` commands. A Project with no Add-ons writes `{}`. |
| `contractVersion` | The major version this Project is held to. Matches the tag its workflow pins and the version this file carries. |

### Two halves, two owners

**The identity** — `slug`, `appName`, `appHost`, `profile`,
`contractVersion` — is written by `project new` when the Project is created,
and is **never edited afterwards**. Everything outside the repository was
named after it: the directory on the host, the secrets project, the database
role, the image repository, the DNS record. Editing the file renames none of
those; it only makes the Manifest disagree with them. `contractVersion` is
the one exception, and it moves only when the Project moves to a new major,
together with the tag its workflow calls.

**The commands** — `migrate` and `seed`, inside the database Add-on —
**belong to the Project**, and change whenever its stack does. Whoever
changes how the schema is migrated changes the command in the same pull
request.

### How the commands are run

Each command is a `{ service, command }`. `service` names a Service of
`docker-compose.prod.yml`, and the `addon-commands` rule checks that the
Stack has it. `command` is a string, and the platform runs it as

```sh
sh -c '<command>'
```

**in place of the image's entrypoint**, in a one-off container of that
Service's image, with `DATABASE_URL` in its environment pointing at the
database to act on. The container is never routed.

- **`migrate`** is run by the deploy, in the image of the Release being
  deployed, **before** the new images serve. A command that fails stops the
  deploy and leaves the previous Release serving.
- **`seed`** writes synthetic data into an empty database, for a Preview.

The Profile runs both on every CI run, against a throwaway database, because
a declared command nobody has run is a Manifest field that is false.

**Why a shell.** It is how both commands behaved before they were declared
here, and it lets a command use the environment it is given:
`psql "$DATABASE_URL" -c 'select 1'` works as written, where an argument
list would need a wrapper to expand `$DATABASE_URL`. The cost is that the
named Service's image must have `sh` on its `PATH`. A Project whose runtime
image is distroless or `scratch` can still migrate: it names another Service,
whose image has a shell and the migration tool.

**Why the entrypoint is replaced.** So that the command is what runs: an
entrypoint that does something of its own with its arguments cannot turn it
into something else. An entrypoint that has to run first is called by the
command.

### What an Add-on is, and what it is not

An Add-on is an **optional dependency on a Shared Platform Service** — a
service the platform runs, that no Project owns and more than one can depend
on. *Optional* is the whole of the distinction: Traefik and the `web` network
are shared too, and they are not Add-ons, because every Project depends on
them and none declares them.

A capability a Project implements **for itself** is not an Add-on, however
much code it takes and however many Projects end up writing it. A login, a
scraper, a third-party integration: those are the Project's, and the platform
has nothing to provide, nothing to provision, and nothing to take away when
the Project is deleted.

**There is no `oauth` Add-on**, and its absence is the surprising part rather
than an oversight: contract `v1` accepted the name and nothing was ever behind
it. ADR-0013 is where that was decided — the platform runs no identity
provider (ADR-0009), so a login is code a Project writes and keeps.

`provider` names which engine backs an Add-on. The platform runs one database
engine (ADR-0005), so there is one value it accepts today — but the Manifest
records it as a value rather than asserting in its own shape that there could
never be a second. Which values are honoured is the `addon-provider` rule
below, so that the answer arrives in the same verdict as every other rule.

Declaring an Add-on commits a Project to what that Add-on's document says:
`docs/addons/database.md`, canonical in this repository beside this file,
copied into the Project and removed with the Add-on.

Configuration lives here rather than in repository variables because a
repository variable is invisible to an agent that can only see the
repository: a Project whose bundle is compiled against a hostname it never
mentions is opaque in exactly the way this platform rules out.

## What deserves a finding

`PLATFORM-FINDINGS.md` is where a Project writes down what it learned that
would be true of **any** Project held to this contract. A Project knows the
contract and not the platform behind it, so the test is put in the
contract's terms:

- **It goes in the file** if it is true of the contract, of the checks, or
  of how a Project is built, deployed and judged. A rule that refused
  something it should have allowed. A rule whose message sent you the wrong
  way. Something this file promises that did not hold. Something the deploy
  needed that no rule asked for. A step you had to take that this file never
  mentions.
- **It stays out** if it is true only of this Project's own code: its
  framework, its schema, its bugs, its decisions. Those belong in the
  Project.

One question sorts most cases: *would the next Project, on a different stack,
have run into it too?* If yes, it is a finding.

Write what happened, what you expected, and what you did instead. An empty
file is a true answer, and a finding nobody can act on is not worth more
than one.

## The rules

### `manifest` — `platform.json` exists and validates

Every other rule reads it. A Project that cannot say what it is cannot be
judged, and an agent that opens the repository cannot say where it deploys.

### `contract-version` — `CONTRACT.md` pins the checker that is running

This file, the Manifest's `contractVersion`, and the checker must agree. A
copy that pins another version is prose that reads as authoritative and is
not being enforced, which is worse than having no copy at all.

### `addon-provider` — every declared Add-on names a provider the platform runs

An Add-on is a dependency on a service the platform operates, so the engine
it names has to be one that exists. Today: `database` is backed by
`postgresql` and by nothing else, which is ADR-0005.

This is a rule rather than a closed list in the schema on purpose. Which
providers exist is policy that changes when an ADR changes, and it belongs
where it can be *reported* — in this verdict, naming what is supported —
rather than one layer earlier, as a Manifest that failed an assertion.

### `platform-findings` — `PLATFORM-FINDINGS.md` exists

Existence and nothing more. An empty file is a true statement, and a Project
that has learned nothing worth carrying should not have to invent something.

A Project is the only place where what this platform is actually like gets
discovered, and what it learns is worth more to the next Project than to
itself. A Project created next year by somebody who deleted the file would
close that channel with nothing saying so — the same shape of failure as a
Project missing from the audit's list. Requiring the file is what makes the
channel a property of a Project rather than a habit of whoever built it.
What goes in it is [What deserves a finding](#what-deserves-a-finding),
above.

### `findings-channel` — `AGENTS.md` points an agent at this file and at the findings

`AGENTS.md` exists, at the root, and names both `CONTRACT.md` and
`PLATFORM-FINDINGS.md`. If a `CLAUDE.md` or a `.claude/CLAUDE.md` exists, it
imports `AGENTS.md`.

A findings file that nothing points at is a channel nobody writes to, and
that is how every Project stood before this rule: carrying the file, with
nothing an agent reads saying it was there. `AGENTS.md` is the instruction
file most coding agents read when they open a repository, so it is the one
the contract requires.

The second half names a vendor's file, in a contract that names no language,
because of one arrangement in which the channel closes silently. Claude Code
reads a `CLAUDE.md` *instead of* `AGENTS.md`, not beside it, unless the
`CLAUDE.md` imports it: a line reading `@AGENTS.md`, or `@../AGENTS.md` from
`.claude/CLAUDE.md`, since an import resolves from the file that writes it.
An import inside backticks or a code block is a mention, which Claude Code
does not follow, and this rule does not count it either. A symlink does not
count, because Git checks one out on Windows as a one-line text file.

What it cannot see: a `CLAUDE.local.md` silences `AGENTS.md` in exactly the
same way, for the one person who has it, and it is never committed. So
`AGENTS.md` itself has to say so.

### `compose-file` — the production Stack renders from the Manifest alone

The Stack is one file, `docker-compose.prod.yml`, at the root. It must render
with only the platform's own values set (see `identity-variables` below),
because that is all the platform knows when it deploys. A Stack requiring a
variable nobody supplies is a Stack that fails at the point of deploying
rather than at the point of checking.

Every rule after this one is asserted against the **rendered** file —
`docker compose config` with the platform's values — and not against the
source text. Grepping the source would pass a Stack whose `ports:` arrives
through a variable. Where a rule reads the source instead, it says so and
says why.

### `no-published-ports` — nothing binds a host port

Traefik owns 80 and 443, and routing is a platform concern. This rule exists
because the first Project shipped its own nginx on both, and deploying it
unchanged would have taken the whole VPS down. A Project that ships its own
reverse proxy is a contract violation, not a preference.

### `no-build` — nothing in the production Stack builds

The host pulls what CI published. Production holds images, not source: it
carries no clone, no `.git` and no deploy key, and it compiles nothing.

### `image-tag` — every image is named by an explicit, immutable tag

Every image's tag comes from `IMAGE_TAG` — the commit the images were
published under — or the image is pinned by digest. No literal tag, and no
missing tag.

A Rollback is re-pointing the Stack at a previous Release's published images,
so a tag that can be moved names different bytes tomorrow and a Release
pinned to one is not pinned to anything. Checked by asking where the tag came
from rather than what it says, because a denylist of floating names —
`latest`, `main`, `stable` — is the obvious implementation and the wrong one:
`v1` is on no such list, and this contract's own release process moves `v1`
every release.

### `identity-variables` — what the platform supplies fails rather than guesses

`PROJECT_SLUG`, `APP_HOST`, `IMAGE_TAG` and `IMAGE_REPO_PREFIX` come from the
Manifest and the release. None of them may carry a default, and
`PROJECT_SLUG` and `IMAGE_TAG` must use the `${VAR:?}` form that refuses to
render when unset.

This is the one rule the rendered file cannot answer — a default is invisible
once it has been substituted — so it reads the source. It is also the rule
with the worst failure mode. A Project copied from another, whose
`PROJECT_SLUG` nobody set, starts a Compose project under the original's name
and registers Traefik routers competing with the original's, on a host
already running them: two Compose projects of one name in different
directories, and two routers answering for one hostname. A missing value must
fail, not resolve to somebody else.

### `traefik-labels` — every routed service says how to reach it

A service carrying any `traefik.http.*` label must also carry
`traefik.enable=true` and `traefik.docker.network=web`. The second is not
boilerplate: a container on more than one network has to name the one Traefik
should dial, and without it Traefik picks one — sometimes `data`, where it is
not.

### `traefik-names` — router and service names derive from the slug

Checked by rendering the Stack with a slug no Project could have written, and
requiring every Traefik router, service and middleware name to have moved
with it. A derived name moves; a typed one does not. A literal name is a
collision waiting for the second Project that copies the file, and two
routers of one name is one Project answering for another.

### `networks` — `web` always, `data` only with the database Add-on

Both networks are created by the platform and joined by a Stack, never
created by one: a `web` that is not `external: true` is a network of the
Project's own that Traefik is not on, and the Stack comes up unreachable.

`data` is separate from `web` because `web` is where Traefik routes — every
Project's frontend sits on it — and a database server does not belong within
reach of all of them. A Stack reaches the shared Postgres because its
Manifest declares a database, or it does not reach it at all.

### `database-url` — the Stack is handed `DATABASE_URL` exactly when it declares a database

`networks` says the Stack is on `data`; this says something in it is handed
the address of a database to reach over it. Both directions, for the same
reason `networks` reads both ways: an Add-on that can be half-applied is an
Add-on whose declaration is decorative.

A Manifest declaring a database whose Stack is handed no URL comes up and
connects to nothing. A Stack handed a URL whose Manifest declares nothing is
a Project nobody created a role for, reaching for a secret that is not in its
Doppler project.

Any service, not a named one: `backend` is one Profile's word for a
container's role, and this contract names none. Which container should get
the value is the Project's business; that the Stack gets it is the
platform's.

### `addon-commands` — every command an Add-on declares names a Service of the Stack

The database Add-on's `migrate` and `seed` each name the Service whose image
runs them, and that Service must be in the rendered `docker-compose.prod.yml`.

A Service name in the Manifest is a reference, so it is checked as one. A
typo there would otherwise surface halfway through a deploy, after the
release's images were pulled; here it fails on the pull request that made it.

### `healthchecks` — every service declares one

A container that is running is not a container that is working. Without a
healthcheck, a deploy's only evidence is that Docker started the process, and
a Stack that comes up broken looks exactly like a Stack that came up.

### `no-env-file` — no service reads a file of values

Secrets are injected into the environment of the process that starts the
Stack, and no file of values is written on the host — so there is none to
leak, none to go stale, and none to be left behind by a deploy.

Read from the source, and the one deliberate exception to judging the
rendered file: `docker compose config` folds an `env_file` into `environment`
and erases the key, so after rendering, a Project reading a file on disk is
indistinguishable from one that is not.

### `no-committed-env` — no `.env` in the repository

The one mistake that puts a real secret somewhere it can never be removed
from. Checked against what git tracks, not against what is in the directory:
a developer's own ignored `.env` is correct and must not fail anybody's
check. `.env.example` is allowed and encouraged — naming the keys is how a
Project stays legible to somebody who holds none of the values.

### `multi-stage-dockerfiles` — build in one stage, run in another

Image size is a contract requirement rather than an optimisation. The
registry's free-plan transfer quota is counted against every pull the
production host makes, and a single-stage image ships the build tree —
compilers, dev dependencies, caches — to production and over that quota on
every deploy.

## Reported, never enforced

**Image size.** The checker names the images a Stack would pull, and fails on
nothing. The number in circulation is not the number that matters: the
argument for small images comes from a 200 MB illustration against a
1 GB/month transfer quota, the first Project's backend image is 582 MB on
disk, and the quota counts *compressed layers over the wire* — which nobody
has measured. A ceiling set from an illustration would reject Projects for
the wrong reason.

It does not weigh them either, which is the honest half. A repository
contains no images, so there is nothing here to put on a scale, and the bytes
a laptop happens to have are neither the number the open question needs nor a
number CI could agree with. When a pull has actually been measured, this
becomes a rule and the contract's version changes.

## Tier 2 — the repository's own settings

Everything above is a file, so it travels in a copy of a repository and the
Project checks it itself, asking for no secret. None of what follows is a
file. A ruleset does not copy with `gh repo create --template` — measured on
a real copy: `rulesets: 0`, `variables: 0`, `secrets: 0` — and reading one
needs a credential.

So tier 2 is **audited centrally**, on a schedule, over a list of Projects,
with one token in one place. No Project holds a credential that can read its
own settings, which is what keeps the tier-1 check safe to publish: a
workflow that asks for no secret cannot leak one.

**The audit reports; it does not block.** The rulesets below are what block.
What the audit is for is the exception somebody added to unblock themselves
and forgot — a thing no check running inside the Project could ever see. An
exception added once is the same as not having the rule.

### `protect-main` — the default branch cannot be pushed to, rewritten or deleted

An active branch ruleset covering `~DEFAULT_BRANCH`, carrying `pull_request`,
`deletion` and `non_fast_forward`, with an **empty bypass list** — the owner
included.

This is the only control in the chain that still holds if an agent token
carrying `contents: write` leaks. Everything else — the secrets manager, the
ephemeral `GITHUB_TOKEN`, the SSH key — protects secrets rather than history.
The target is `~DEFAULT_BRANCH` and not a literal branch name, because
renaming the branch would otherwise leave the protection pointing at nothing;
a literal is reported as the weakness it is rather than as an absence.

### `required-checks` — a pull request cannot land until the platform's checks pass

A `required_status_checks` rule naming at least `test` and
`contract / tier-1`, with `strict` on.

Without it the checks run, go red, and the merge button stays green:
reporting a failure and refusing a merge are different things. `strict` is
the second half — without it a branch can land on a trunk it was never tested
against, which makes the trunk the thing that discovers the problem. A
Project requiring *more* contexts is not drift.

### `protect-releases` — an existing release tag cannot be moved or deleted

An active tag ruleset covering `refs/tags/v*`, carrying `update`, `deletion`
and `non_fast_forward`, with an empty bypass list.

A branch ruleset covers branches, and **a tag is what deploys**. Without
this, a leaked `contents: write` token needs nothing else: move `v1.2.0` onto
a commit of its choosing and the next deploy of that release ships it, with
the default branch untouched throughout.

`update` is the rule that does the work, and the other two do not replace it.
Measured against a throwaway repository on 2026-09-18: with `deletion` and
`non_fast_forward` alone, a `v*` tag can still be moved **forward** onto any
descendant commit — including a hostile commit built on top of the reviewed
one. Deletion protection is not immutability.

Creating a tag stays allowed, because tagging a release is the operator's
deliberate act. That leaves a residue this tier cannot close — a *new* tag on
a commit that was never reviewed — and it is closed in the Profile instead:
the deploy workflow refuses a release whose commit is not an ancestor of the
default branch.

### `contract-version` — the Project pins the version that is current

`contractVersion` in the Manifest, against the contract the audit runs from.

A Project moves major deliberately and nothing moves it for them, which is
the point. The cost is that a Project can sit on an old version indefinitely
with nothing failing, and this is what notices.

### `contract-document` — the copies of the platform's documents are canonical

This file, and each declared Add-on's document, compared byte for byte with
line endings normalised.

The tier-1 `contract-version` rule compares the pinned *version* and not the
text, on purpose: a prose fix must not fail every Project at once. Here it is
only a report, so it can afford to be exact. A copy that has drifted is worse
than no copy, because it reads as authoritative.

The Add-on documents are judged the same way and in both directions, because
they travel the same way: copied in with the Add-on, removed with it. A
Project carrying `docs/addons/database.md` and declaring no database is
describing a capability it does not have — which is exactly what `oauth` was
for a version and a half — and a Project that declares one and carries a copy
from two versions ago is reading rules that are not the ones being enforced.

Tier 1 checks neither. Documents that are *copies of the platform's* can only
be judged against the originals, and only this tier can see them; a tier-1
rule could ask that a file exists and never that it says the right thing,
which is the half that matters.

### `no-repository-variables` — configuration is the Manifest

`gh variable list` on a conforming Project returns nothing.

A repository variable is invisible to an agent whose scope is the repository:
nothing in the files says the value exists, so a Project whose bundle is
compiled against a hostname its own files never mention is opaque in exactly
the way this platform rules out. Reading them needs a token permission the
audit would rather not hold than hold unnecessarily, so a token without it
reports this rule as **not checked** — which is deliberately not the same as
passed.

## Versions

Pinned by a moving major tag. `@v3` is the current `v3.x.y`, so a Project
pinned at `@v3` picks up fixes without doing anything.

**`v1` and `v2` are frozen.** Each points where it pointed on the day the
next major was released, and neither will move again. A Project pinned at
`@v2` keeps passing the rules it was written against, indefinitely, and the
tier-2 `contract-version` rule is what says it is behind — weekly, in a
report, rather than by turning red on a morning nobody chose. That is the
whole reason a tag stops moving: a breaking change published under a tag somebody already pins is a change they
never agreed to.

Changing a rule is a version bump. A change that would newly refuse a Project
which passes today is a **major** bump, and Projects move to it deliberately,
one at a time — so nothing starts failing on a morning when nobody touched
it.
